Introduction to RUST Programming

Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time, however, the compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.
## Quick Start

Un-comment the file function to run

```bash
# Run With Cargo
cargo run

# Build
cargo build

# Build for production
cargo build --release
```

Variables in RUST
``` bash
Variables hold primitive data or references ot data
Variables are immutable by default in rust
Rust is a block-scoped language
```

Data Types:
``` bash
Primitive Types--
Integers: u8, i8, u16, i16, u32, i32, u64, i64, u128, i128 (number of bits they take in memory)
Floats: f32, f64
Boolean (bool)
Characters (char)
Tuples
Arrays

```
